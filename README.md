# TeslaBleHttpProxy

TeslaBleHttpProxy is a program written in Go that receives HTTP requests and forwards them via Bluetooth to a Tesla vehicle. The program can, for example, be easily used together with [evcc](https://github.com/evcc-io/evcc).

The program stores the received requests in a queue and processes them one by one. This ensures that only one Bluetooth connection to the vehicle is established at a time.

## How to install

You can either compile and use the Go program yourself or install it in a Docker container. ([detailed instruction](docs/installation.md))

### Docker compose

Below you will find the necessary contents for your `docker-compose.yml`:

```
services:
  tesla-ble-http-proxy:
    image: wimaha/tesla-ble-http-proxy
    container_name: tesla-ble-http-proxy
    volumes:
      - ~/TeslaBleHttpProxy/key:/key
      - /var/run/dbus:/var/run/dbus
    restart: always
    privileged: true
    network_mode: host
    cap_add:
      - NET_ADMIN
      - SYS_ADMIN
```

Please remember to create an empty folder where the keys can be stored later. In this example, it is `~/TeslaBleHttpProxy/key`.

Pull and start TeslaBleHttpProxy with `docker compose up -d`.

### Build yourself

Download the code and save it in a folder named 'TeslaBleHttpProxy'. From there, you can easily compile the program.

```
go build .
./TeslaBleHttpProxy
```

Please remember to create an empty folder called `key` where the keys can be stored later.


## Start TBHP as an automatic starting Service (/etc/systemd/system) (Example on a Raspi Pi 3B)

go to /etc/systemd/system and create a new service entry:
`sudo nano TBHP.service`

Paste the following text into the file:
```
[Unit]
Description=Tesla Ble Http Proxy

[Service]
Type=simple
User=pi
WorkingDirectory=/home/pi/TeslaBleHttpProxy
ExecStart=/usr/local/go/bin/go run .
Restart=failure
RestartSec=10

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
Save the file and reload Service Daemon:
`sudo systemctl daemon-reload`

Start Service:
`sudo systemctl enable TBHP.service`

## Generate key for vehicle

*(Here, the simple, automatic method is described. Besides the automatic method, you can also generate the keys [manually](docs/manually_gen_key.md).)*

To generate the required keys browse to `http://YOUR_IP:8080/dashboard`. In the dashboard you will see that the keys are missing:

Please click on `generate Keys` and the keys will be automatically generated and saved.

<img src="docs/proxy2.png" alt="Picture of the Dashboard with success message and keys." width="40%" height="40%">

After that please enter your VIN under `Setup Vehicle`. Before you proceed make sure your vehicle is awake! So you have to manually wake the vehicle before you send the key to the vehicle.

Finally the keys is send to the vehicle. You have to confirm by tapping your NFC card on center console.

You can now close the dashboard and use the proxy. ðŸ™‚

## Setup EVCC

***Since version 0.128.0 or newer of evcc it is very easy to integrate ble proxy:***
```
- name: model3
    type: template
    template: tesla
    title: Tesla
    icon: car
    accessToken: YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
    refreshToken: YOUR_REFRSH_TOKEN
    capacity: 60
    commandProxy: http://YOUR_IP:8080
```

If you want to use an older version:


***Attention: You have to use at least version 0.127.2 or newer of evcc***
Below is a sample configuration of a custom vehicle in evcc:

```
vehicles:
  - name: model3
    type: custom
    title: Tesla Model 3
    capacity: 60
    chargeenable:
      source: http
      uri: "http://IP:8080/api/1/vehicles/VIN/command/{{if .chargeenable}}charge_start{{else}}charge_stop{{end}}"
      method: POST
      body: ""
    maxcurrent: # set charger max current (A)
      source: http
      uri: http://IP:8080/api/1/vehicles/VIN/command/set_charging_amps
      method: POST
      body: '{"charging_amps": "{{.maxcurrent}}"}'
    wakeup: # vehicle wake up command
      source: http
      uri: http://IP:8080/api/1/vehicles/VIN/command/wake_up
      method: POST
      body: ""
    soc:
      source: [Your Source ...]
    range:
      source: [Your Source ...]
    status:
      source: combined
      plugged:
        source: [Your Source ...]
      charging:
        source: [Your Source ...]
```

## API

The program uses the same interfaces as the Tesla [Fleet API](https://developer.tesla.com/docs/fleet-api#vehicle-commands). Currently, the following requests are supported: 

- wake_up
- charge_start
- charge_stop
- set_charging_amps
- set_charge_limit
- flash_lights
